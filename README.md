# previewgz

To facilitate the inscription of heavy files we realized that a gzip file previewer is needed. Using recursive technology and js decompression we are able to generate very heavy inscription at one-third of the cost, making it possible to create increasingly complex bitcoin enrollments at affordable cost.

Using recursive technology to integrate the compressed gzip file written to BTC and unzip the downloaded file, we can view the already decompressed file directly from the browser. This allows a file weighing 220kb to be written at 70kb opening the door for a new narrative in the world of inscription.
